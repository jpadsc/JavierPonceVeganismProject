## Introduction

In recent years, the culinary landscape has witnessed a surge in interest and demand for vegan options due to the increase in popularity of veganism. Additionally, and in more recent years, there's been an active discussion about the impact of animal source foods on the environment and how to diminish it. As a reflection of this, we've seen the popularization of plant-based replacements for meats and other animal-source foods such as the IMPOSSIBLE burger. Personally, I am not vegan, in fact, I really like beef, but I do understand that diminishing our current consumption of meats and other animal sources of food is essential for the preservation of planet Earth. That is why, in this project, I am going to use a data set from Food.com to analyze veganism in the given data set, and at the end of this project, I'll answer if the data frame shows that we like Vegan foods or not.

As I've mentioned, the data I'll use in this project comes from Food.com. The data came from two different CSVs which I'll be using both as individual data frames and as a big merged one.
